# GenAI Agentic Patterns

This repository contains a collection of demo projects and patterns for building GenAI agents using LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI, Semantic Kernel, and related frameworks. Each subfolder in `src/` demonstrates a specific agentic pattern, memory technique, or integration with LLMs and tools.
